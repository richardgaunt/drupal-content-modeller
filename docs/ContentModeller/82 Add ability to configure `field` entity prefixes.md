We configure field machine name prefixes in `ENTITY_PREFIXES`

I would like to be able to configure this in:
- Create Project and Edit Project
Application should provide the default field prefix for each entity type but allow user to edit it for the project. This is in turn saved to the project.json file and used in future edits.
